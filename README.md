### Story Behind the Pack
A large part of your screen can often be obstructed by your held item of choice, which can make the rest of the game often feel cramped at times. To resolve this significant issue, I created the Small Items resource pack! This wonderful assortment of rescales and recreations results in a more open feeling while keeping the new looks near and dear to vanilla Minecraft. Hopefully, this resource pack can keep you focussed on your goals instead of the center of your sword.
